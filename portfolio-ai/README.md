# 🤖 AI Portfolio – Prajwal K M

This is my **personal portfolio website**, designed to be **AI-powered** and interactive, inspired by conversational interfaces like ChatGPT.

The goal of this project is to let visitors **ask questions about me** — my background, skills, projects, and journey — instead of reading static pages.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> The AI functionality is currently **under development**.  
> The UI, architecture, and interaction flow are fully implemented and ready.  
> Live AI responses will be enabled soon.
